You will need four soul sands and three wither skulls to spawn it. Place the last wither skull on the top center soul sand to spawn it.\r\nIt's much larger than the normal wither boss and as a result also much stronger. It's most likely impossible to defeat this boss all by yourself. But if you do, be sure to let us know in the comments how you did it!\r\n\r\nShooting arrows is probably the easiest way to damage the mob in MCPE in the beginning as it gives you the necessary range to avoid the explosions. If you get a direct hit by a wither skull then you'll get a levitation effect and it's a risk you'll get killed next. If a wither skull hits the ground then it will cause a lingering wither effect for 12 seconds.\r\n\r\nBy the second hand, the mob becomes invulnerable to arrows, I advise you to use a sword or the example below!\r\n\r\nThe best choice for fighting after the second stage is sword fighting, but you will likely find it difficult to approach. I advise you to put up a large number of minecraft TNT's before the battle. Once you are unable to damage the boss, lure him onto TNT and set it on fire. The damage will be critical, at least so you can fight this invincible creature in minecraft.\r\n\r\nFor defeating the boss himself, you will receive a Downworld Star as a reward. This is certainly not the best reward for winning the biggest boss in Minecraft Pocket Edition. But it's definitely a feat worth boasting of! At least if you defeated it in survival mode which I surely didn't.\r\n\r\nGood luck with your minecraft adventures and fighting the biggest boss in MCPE!\r\n\r\nNow let's talk a little about the functionality of the application itself:\r\nThere are 4 options for mods in the application!
